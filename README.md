# Utilities-in-Cpp
This project aims to demonstrate my skills in C++. I've included basic programs that showcase my knowledge and abilities in coding, with the purpose of seeking a junior developer position. This repository also features a program designed for the administration of a group of investors, which I developed for a friend.
